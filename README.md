# Portfolio

This project is a Single Page Application website that uses a Redux store design pattern.  The product is designed to collect and show my, Thomasgpw's, personal works and experiments with HTML5 canvas and the project is designed as a fully independent learning experience for myself to build knowledge and expertice in every aspect of web architecture and common frameworks.
The live build can be reached at [thomasportfolio.herokuapp.com](https://thomasportfolio.herokuapp.com/).
The development documentation, including my interation one conclusion, can be found in [this shared google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B21LGG1_5OyOTEEyRVlydjMtcm8?usp=sharing).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.1, runs on [Angular 4](https://angular.io) version 4.2.4, and utilizes the invaluable [ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx) and [ng-inline-svg](https://github.com/arkon/ng-inline-svg).

The build engines used are [node](https://nodejs.org) version 8.3.0 and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) version 5.3.0.
