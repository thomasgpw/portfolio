This project is a Single Page Application website designed to collect and show my, Thomasgpw's, personal works and experiments with HTML5 canvas.
The live build can be reached at [thomasg.pw](https://thomasg.pw).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.1, runs on [Angular 4](https://angular.io) version 4.2.4, and utilizes [ng-inline-svg](https://github.com/arkon/ng-inline-svg).

The build engines used are [node](https://nodejs.org) version 8.3.0 and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) version 5.3.0.

## Getting Started

Run `node server.js` to run a production server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

### Prerequisites

Both [node](https://nodejs.org) version 8.3.0 or greater and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) version 5.3.0 or greater are required to install build, and run the site.

### Installing dev version

Clone the project at 'clone target'. I have to figure out what else you need to do.  Running 'ng serve' in the root folder will start the dev server if all dependencies and devDependencies are installed

## Running tests

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
